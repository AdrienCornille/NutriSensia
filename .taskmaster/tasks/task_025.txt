# Task ID: 25
# Title: Performance Optimization
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 2, 6, 7, 14
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement performance optimizations across the platform including code splitting, image optimization, caching strategies, and core web vitals improvements.
# Details:
Implement code splitting using Next.js dynamic imports. Set up image optimization with next/image. Create efficient caching strategies with TanStack Query. Implement service worker for offline capabilities and caching. Add resource hints (preconnect, prefetch) for critical resources. Optimize font loading with font-display and preloading. Implement lazy loading for below-the-fold content. Create bundle analysis and optimization workflow. Implement server-side rendering for critical pages. Add client-side rendering for interactive components. Optimize third-party script loading. Implement performance monitoring and budgets.

# Test Strategy:
Core Web Vitals measurement with Lighthouse and Web Vitals API. Performance testing across devices and connection speeds. A/B testing of performance optimizations. User-centric performance metrics tracking. Bundle size monitoring. Test offline functionality. Measure Time to Interactive and other key metrics before and after optimizations.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Code Splitting Implementation [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement code splitting using Next.js dynamic imports to reduce initial bundle size and improve page load times
### Details:
Use Next.js dynamic imports with the 'dynamic' function to lazy load components. Identify components that aren't needed for initial render. Implement loading states for dynamically imported components. Configure webpack chunk naming for better debugging. Set up error boundaries around dynamically loaded components to handle loading failures gracefully.

## 2. Image Optimization Setup [pending]
### Dependencies: 25.1
### Description: Configure next/image for automatic image optimization, responsive sizing, and modern format delivery
### Details:
Replace standard <img> tags with next/image components. Configure image domains in next.config.js. Implement responsive image sizing with appropriate breakpoints. Set up image quality parameters for optimal compression. Create image loading placeholders for improved perceived performance. Configure WebP and AVIF format delivery where supported.

## 3. Caching Strategy Implementation [pending]
### Dependencies: 25.1, 25.2
### Description: Develop efficient caching strategies using TanStack Query and implement service worker for offline capabilities
### Details:
Configure TanStack Query with appropriate staleTime and cacheTime settings for different data types. Implement optimistic updates for improved UX. Set up background data refetching. Register and configure a service worker for offline caching. Create cache invalidation strategies. Implement offline-first data fetching patterns. Add cache persistence between sessions.

## 4. Core Web Vitals Optimization [pending]
### Dependencies: 25.1, 25.2, 25.3
### Description: Improve Core Web Vitals metrics including LCP, FID, and CLS through targeted optimizations
### Details:
Identify and optimize Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) elements. Implement font optimization with font-display and preloading. Add resource hints (preconnect, prefetch) for critical resources. Optimize third-party script loading with async/defer attributes. Implement layout shift prevention techniques. Create fixed-size placeholders for dynamic content. Optimize JavaScript execution to improve First Input Delay (FID).

## 5. Rendering Strategy Optimization [pending]
### Dependencies: 25.1, 25.2, 25.3, 25.4
### Description: Implement optimal rendering strategies including SSR for critical pages and CSR for interactive components
### Details:
Identify pages that benefit most from Server-Side Rendering. Configure SSR for critical landing pages. Implement Client-Side Rendering for highly interactive components. Set up Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR) for semi-dynamic content. Create bundle analysis workflow to identify optimization opportunities. Implement lazy loading for below-the-fold content. Set up performance budgets and monitoring.
