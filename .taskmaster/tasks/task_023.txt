# Task ID: 23
# Title: CI/CD Pipeline Implementation
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 22
# Priority: high
# Description: Set up continuous integration and deployment pipelines using GitHub Actions and Vercel with proper environment management.
# Details:
Configure GitHub Actions workflows for CI/CD. Set up Vercel project with environment configurations. Implement branch preview deployments. Create deployment protection rules for production. Set up environment variable management across environments. Implement database migration automation. Create rollback procedures for failed deployments. Set up deployment notifications in Slack or similar. Implement feature flags for controlled rollouts. Create deployment documentation. Set up automated smoke tests post-deployment. Implement performance budget enforcement in CI.

# Test Strategy:
Test CI/CD pipeline with various scenarios (pass, fail, partial). Verify environment isolation between deployments. Test rollback procedures. Validate feature flag functionality. Test notification systems. Verify performance budgets are enforced. Test database migrations across environments.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Configure GitHub Actions Workflows [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up CI workflows for testing, linting, and building the application using GitHub Actions.
### Details:
Create .github/workflows directory with YAML configuration files. Implement workflow for running tests, linting code, and building the application. Configure caching for dependencies to speed up builds. Set up matrix testing for different Node.js versions. Implement status checks for pull requests.

## 2. Set Up Vercel Project with Environment Configurations [pending]
### Dependencies: 23.1
### Description: Configure Vercel project with proper environment settings for development, staging, and production.
### Details:
Create Vercel project and link to GitHub repository. Configure environment variables for development, staging, and production environments. Set up domain configurations for each environment. Implement branch-to-environment mapping (main → production, develop → staging). Configure build and output settings in vercel.json.

## 3. Implement Database Migration Automation [pending]
### Dependencies: 23.2
### Description: Create automated database migration process that runs during deployment with safety checks.
### Details:
Set up migration scripts using Prisma or similar ORM. Create GitHub Action to run migrations during deployment process. Implement database backup before migrations. Add validation steps to prevent destructive migrations in production. Create rollback mechanism for failed migrations. Configure migration logging for audit purposes.

## 4. Implement Deployment Notifications and Protection Rules [pending]
### Dependencies: 23.2, 23.3
### Description: Set up deployment notifications in Slack and implement protection rules for production deployments.
### Details:
Configure Slack webhook integration for deployment notifications. Create custom notification messages for deployment events (started, completed, failed). Implement protection rules for production environment requiring manual approval. Set up deployment concurrency limits to prevent simultaneous deployments. Create deployment dashboard for monitoring status.

## 5. Implement Feature Flags and Documentation [pending]
### Dependencies: 23.1, 23.2, 23.4
### Description: Set up feature flag system for controlled rollouts and create comprehensive CI/CD documentation.
### Details:
Implement feature flag system using a service like LaunchDarkly or a custom solution. Create feature flag management interface. Set up automated smoke tests that run post-deployment. Implement performance budget enforcement in CI pipeline. Create comprehensive documentation covering the entire CI/CD process, including environment management, deployment procedures, rollback processes, and feature flag usage.

## 6. Canary Deployments and Progressive Rollout [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement canary deployments and progressive rollout strategies
### Details:
Set up canary deployment infrastructure for gradual feature releases. Implement progressive rollout strategies with percentage-based user targeting. Create feature flag management system for controlled rollouts. Add support for automated rollback mechanisms and health checks. Implement deployment analytics and impact monitoring. Create canary deployment dashboard for monitoring and control. Add support for A/B testing integration with deployment strategies.
