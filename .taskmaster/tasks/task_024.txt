# Task ID: 24
# Title: Error Monitoring and Logging
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 23
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement comprehensive error monitoring, logging, and alerting using Sentry and custom logging solutions.
# Details:
Set up Sentry for error tracking and monitoring. Implement custom error boundaries in React components. Create structured logging system for server operations. Set up alert thresholds and notification channels. Implement user feedback collection on errors. Create error categorization and prioritization system. Set up performance monitoring for key transactions. Implement breadcrumb tracking for error context. Create dashboard for error trends and hotspots. Set up log retention policies compliant with regulations. Implement rate limiting for error reporting. Create runbooks for common error scenarios.

# Test Strategy:
Intentionally trigger errors to verify capture. Test error grouping and deduplication. Verify alert delivery across channels. Test performance impact of error monitoring. Validate user feedback collection. Test log rotation and retention. Verify compliance with privacy regulations for logged data.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Sentry Integration Setup [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up Sentry for error tracking and monitoring across frontend and backend environments
### Details:
Install Sentry SDK packages for Next.js and configure environment variables for different environments (development, staging, production). Set up source maps uploading for accurate error stack traces. Configure Sentry project settings including alert rules, team access, and integration with GitHub for issue tracking. Implement Sentry initialization in _app.js or equivalent for frontend and in API routes for backend services.

## 2. React Error Boundaries Implementation [pending]
### Dependencies: 24.1
### Description: Implement custom error boundaries in React components with fallback UIs
### Details:
Create a reusable ErrorBoundary component that catches JavaScript errors in child component trees. Implement fallback UI components that provide user-friendly error messages and recovery options. Add error reporting to Sentry within error boundaries including component context. Create specialized error boundaries for critical application sections like authentication, data visualization, and form submission flows. Implement retry mechanisms where appropriate.

## 3. Structured Logging System [pending]
### Dependencies: 24.1
### Description: Create a structured logging system for server operations with different log levels
### Details:
Implement a structured logging system using Winston or Pino that supports different log levels (debug, info, warn, error, fatal). Create consistent log format with timestamps, request IDs, user context, and structured data. Implement log transport configuration for different environments (console for development, file/service for production). Add request context middleware to enrich logs with request data. Create utility functions for standardized logging across the application.

## 4. Alert System and Notification Channels [pending]
### Dependencies: 24.1, 24.3
### Description: Set up alert thresholds, notification channels, and escalation policies
### Details:
Configure alert thresholds for different error types and frequencies in Sentry. Set up notification channels including email, Slack, and SMS for critical alerts. Implement PagerDuty or similar service integration for urgent issues requiring immediate attention. Create escalation policies based on error severity and resolution time. Implement rate limiting for notifications to prevent alert fatigue. Configure working hours and on-call schedules for the team.

## 5. Error Analytics Dashboard [pending]
### Dependencies: 24.1, 24.3, 24.4
### Description: Create a dashboard for error trends, hotspots, and performance monitoring
### Details:
Develop a custom dashboard that aggregates error data from Sentry and the logging system. Implement visualizations for error trends over time, most frequent errors, and error distribution by component/route. Create performance monitoring for key transactions with alerting for degradations. Implement user impact metrics to prioritize issues affecting the most users. Add filtering capabilities by error type, component, and time period. Set up automated weekly reports for the development team.
