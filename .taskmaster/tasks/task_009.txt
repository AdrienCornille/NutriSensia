# Task ID: 9
# Title: Nutritional Database Integration
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Integrate USDA FoodData Central and Ciqual ANSES databases with Redis caching for fast food data access and search functionality.
# Details:
Set up data ingestion pipelines for USDA FoodData Central API and Ciqual ANSES database. Create a normalized database schema in Supabase for storing food data. Implement Redis caching layer using Upstash or similar service for frequently accessed food items. Build an Elasticsearch index for fast food search with autocomplete. Create API endpoints for food search, nutritional information retrieval, and portion calculation. Implement daily synchronization jobs using cron tasks to keep data updated. Create fallback mechanisms for offline operation with core food items. Build food categorization and filtering system. Implement portion size conversion utilities. Create data versioning to track database updates.

# Test Strategy:
Unit tests for data transformation and normalization. Performance testing for search operations. Cache hit ratio monitoring. Integration tests for API endpoints. Test synchronization jobs and error handling. Test offline fallback mechanisms. Load testing with concurrent searches.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Database Schema Design and Setup [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a normalized database schema in Supabase for storing food data from USDA FoodData Central and Ciqual ANSES databases.
### Details:
Design tables for foods, nutrients, portions, categories, and relationships. Include fields for source tracking (USDA vs Ciqual). Create appropriate indexes for efficient querying. Set up foreign key relationships and constraints. Document the schema with ERD diagrams. Configure Supabase permissions and access controls.

## 2. Data Ingestion Pipeline Implementation [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.1
### Description: Set up automated data ingestion pipelines for USDA FoodData Central API and Ciqual ANSES database.
### Details:
Create ETL processes for both data sources. Implement API client for USDA FoodData Central. Develop parser for Ciqual ANSES data files. Build data transformation logic to normalize between different formats. Implement data validation and cleaning procedures. Create logging and error handling for ingestion processes. Set up initial data load process.

## 3. Redis Caching Layer Implementation [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.1, 9.2
### Description: Implement Redis caching using Upstash for frequently accessed food items and search results.
### Details:
Set up Upstash Redis instance with appropriate configuration. Implement caching strategies for common queries (popular foods, recent searches). Create cache invalidation mechanisms for data updates. Implement TTL policies based on data access patterns. Build monitoring for cache hit/miss ratios. Create fallback mechanisms for cache failures.

## 4. Search Functionality with Elasticsearch [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.1, 9.2
### Description: Build an Elasticsearch index for fast food search with autocomplete and filtering capabilities.
### Details:
Set up Elasticsearch instance and configure mappings for food data. Implement indexing process for all food items. Create search API with autocomplete functionality. Implement filters for food categories, nutrients, and dietary restrictions. Optimize relevance scoring for search results. Build reindexing process for data updates. Implement fuzzy matching for typo tolerance.

## 5. API Endpoints and Synchronization Jobs [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.1, 9.2, 9.3, 9.4
### Description: Create API endpoints for food data access and implement daily synchronization jobs to keep data updated.
### Details:
Develop RESTful API endpoints for food search, nutritional information retrieval, and portion calculation. Implement daily cron jobs for data synchronization with source databases. Create data versioning system to track updates. Build offline fallback mechanisms with core food items. Implement portion size conversion utilities. Create food categorization system. Add documentation for API endpoints using Swagger or similar.

## 6. Data Versioning and Migration Management [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement data versioning and migration management for nutritional database
### Details:
Create a data versioning system to track changes in nutritional data over time. Implement migration scripts for database schema updates and data transformations. Set up data validation and integrity checks during migrations. Create rollback mechanisms for failed migrations. Implement data quality monitoring and alerting for nutritional data. Add support for data source versioning and compatibility management. Create documentation and audit trails for all data changes.
