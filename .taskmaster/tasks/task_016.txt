# Task ID: 16
# Title: Barcode Scanner Implementation
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 9, 15
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop a barcode scanning feature for quick food logging with manual input for MVP and preparation for ML-based automatic scanning in V2.
# Details:
Implement client-side barcode scanning using quagga.js or zbar.wasm. Create integration with Open Food Facts API for product lookup. Build fallback manual entry form for unrecognized products. Implement scan history for quick re-logging. Add product favoriting functionality. Create database schema for storing scanned product information locally. Implement offline scanning capability with local database. Add product submission for missing items. Create admin interface for reviewing submitted products. Implement analytics for scan success rates. Prepare architecture for future ML-based automatic scanning in V2.

# Test Strategy:
Unit tests for barcode parsing and validation. Integration tests with Open Food Facts API. E2E tests for scanning and logging workflow. Test with various barcode formats and lighting conditions. Performance testing for scanning speed. Test offline functionality. User testing with actual food products.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement Client-Side Barcode Scanning [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Integrate quagga.js or zbar.wasm for client-side barcode scanning functionality with camera access and barcode detection capabilities
### Details:
Research and compare quagga.js and zbar.wasm libraries for performance and compatibility. Implement camera access with proper permissions handling. Create a scanning interface with viewfinder and feedback indicators. Handle various barcode formats (EAN-13, UPC-A, etc.). Implement error handling for poor lighting conditions or unreadable barcodes. Add vibration/sound feedback on successful scan.

## 2. Integrate Open Food Facts API [pending]
### Dependencies: 16.1
### Description: Create a service to query the Open Food Facts API with scanned barcodes and process returned product information
### Details:
Implement API client for Open Food Facts with proper error handling and rate limiting. Create data models for product information. Implement caching strategy to reduce API calls. Map API response to application data model. Handle internationalization of product data. Create fallback strategies for API downtime. Implement logging for failed lookups for future improvement.

## 3. Build Manual Entry Form and Local Database [pending]
### Dependencies: 16.2
### Description: Create a fallback form for manual product entry and implement local database schema for storing scanned products
### Details:
Design and implement form for manual product entry with nutritional information fields. Create database schema for storing product information locally. Implement form validation for nutritional data. Create migrations for database schema. Implement data normalization for consistent storage. Add ability to attach photos to manually entered products. Create indexing strategy for efficient lookups.

## 4. Implement Scan History and Favorites [pending]
### Dependencies: 16.3
### Description: Create functionality for viewing scan history, quick re-logging of previous items, and favoriting products for easy access
### Details:
Implement scan history view with sorting and filtering options. Create favoriting functionality with star/unstar UI. Implement quick re-logging from history or favorites with one tap. Add search functionality within scan history. Create data structures for efficient history storage. Implement pagination for large history lists. Add ability to bulk select items from history for logging.

## 5. Develop Offline Capabilities and Missing Product Submission [pending]
### Dependencies: 16.3, 16.4
### Description: Implement offline scanning functionality and create a system for users to submit missing products to the database
### Details:
Implement offline mode detection and graceful degradation. Create local storage for scanned items when offline. Implement sync mechanism for when connection is restored. Build product submission form for missing items. Create queue system for pending submissions. Implement admin review interface for submitted products. Add notification system for submission status updates. Create data validation for submitted products.

## 6. Analytics and Machine Learning Infrastructure [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement analytics and ML infrastructure for barcode scanning improvement
### Details:
Set up analytics infrastructure to collect scanning data and usage patterns. Implement machine learning pipeline for product recognition improvement. Create data collection and preprocessing for ML training. Add support for common product identification and categorization. Implement feedback loop for scanning accuracy improvement. Create analytics dashboard for scanning performance metrics. Add support for offline ML model updates and continuous learning.
