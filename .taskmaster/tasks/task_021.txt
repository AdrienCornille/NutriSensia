# Task ID: 21
# Title: Security and Compliance Implementation
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 3
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement comprehensive security measures and ensure GDPR/HDS compliance with proper data handling, encryption, and audit trails.
# Details:
Implement security headers using next-helmet or similar package. Set up CSRF protection for all forms. Create data encryption for sensitive information using AES-256. Implement audit trails for all data access and modifications. Create user consent management system with versioned terms. Implement data export functionality for GDPR compliance. Add data deletion workflows for right to be forgotten. Create privacy policy and terms generator based on enabled features. Implement session timeout and automatic logout. Add IP-based suspicious activity detection. Create admin tools for security monitoring. Implement regular security scanning with OWASP guidelines.

# Test Strategy:
Security penetration testing with tools like OWASP ZAP. Compliance audit against GDPR and HDS requirements. Unit tests for encryption/decryption functions. Integration tests for consent management. Test data export and deletion workflows. Test audit trail accuracy and completeness. Third-party security audit before launch.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Security Headers and CSRF Protection [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement security headers using next-helmet and set up CSRF protection for all forms in the application.

### Details:
Create encryption/decryption utilities using AES-256 for sensitive user data including health information and payment details. Implement database schema for storing encrypted data. Create middleware for automatic encryption/decryption during data access. Develop comprehensive audit trail system that logs all data access, modifications, and deletions with timestamps, user IDs, and IP addresses. Implement database models for audit logs with appropriate indexing for performance.

## 3. User Consent Management System [pending]
### Dependencies: 21.2
### Description: Create a versioned consent management system with privacy policy and terms generator based on enabled features.

Develop a consent management system that tracks user agreement to terms and privacy policies. Implement versioning for terms and privacy policies. Create a dynamic generator for privacy policies and terms based on enabled features. Build UI components for displaying and accepting terms. Implement database schema for storing user consent with timestamps and version information. Create admin interface for managing terms versions and content.

## 4. GDPR Compliance Features [pending]
### Dependencies: 21.3
### Description: Implement data export functionality and deletion workflows for GDPR right to access and right to be forgotten compliance.
### Details:
Create API endpoints for users to request data exports in machine-readable formats (JSON, CSV). Implement comprehensive data export that includes all user data across all tables. Develop secure download mechanism for exported data. Create admin-approved data deletion workflows for right to be forgotten requests. Implement partial and complete data deletion options. Build notification system for data request status updates. Create audit logs specifically for GDPR-related actions.

## 5. Security Monitoring and Threat Detection [pending]
### Dependencies: 21.2, 21.4
### Description: Implement session management, suspicious activity detection, and admin security monitoring tools.
### Details:
Create session timeout and automatic logout functionality after periods of inactivity. Implement IP-based suspicious activity detection for login attempts and sensitive operations. Develop rate limiting for authentication endpoints. Create admin dashboard for security monitoring with real-time alerts for suspicious activities. Implement regular automated security scanning based on OWASP guidelines. Create reporting tools for security incidents and resolution tracking.
