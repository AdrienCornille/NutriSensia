# Task ID: 22
# Title: Testing Infrastructure Setup
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Set up comprehensive testing infrastructure including unit tests with Jest, E2E tests with Playwright, and quality assurance tools.
# Details:
Configure Jest for unit and integration testing. Set up React Testing Library for component testing. Implement Playwright for E2E testing across browsers. Create testing utilities and mocks for common operations. Set up test database seeding for consistent test data. Implement visual regression testing with Playwright. Create accessibility testing with axe-core. Set up performance testing with Lighthouse CI. Implement test coverage reporting and thresholds. Create GitHub Actions workflows for automated testing. Set up error boundary testing. Implement API contract testing.

# Test Strategy:
Meta-testing to ensure test reliability. Coverage analysis to identify gaps. Test performance of the test suite itself. Regular review and refactoring of tests. Documentation of testing patterns and best practices. Training for team members on testing approach.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Configure Jest and React Testing Library [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up Jest for unit and integration testing along with React Testing Library for component testing
### Details:
Install Jest, React Testing Library, and related dependencies. Configure Jest in package.json with appropriate settings for the Next.js environment. Create jest.config.js with proper transformers and module mappers. Set up test utilities folder with common testing helpers. Configure React Testing Library with custom renders that include providers (theme, auth, etc.). Create initial test examples for components and utilities.

## 2. Implement Playwright for E2E Testing [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up Playwright for end-to-end testing across multiple browsers with visual regression capabilities
### Details:
Install Playwright and configure it to test across Chrome, Firefox, and Safari. Set up E2E test directory structure with page object models. Create helper functions for common test operations. Implement visual regression testing capabilities. Configure test recording and screenshot capture. Set up test fixtures for authentication and common application states. Create initial E2E test examples covering critical user flows.

## 3. Set Up Test Database and Mocking [pending]
### Dependencies: 22.1
### Description: Configure test database seeding and create mocking utilities for consistent test data
### Details:
Create a separate test database configuration for Supabase. Implement database seeding scripts to populate test data. Set up data factories using a library like Faker.js for generating test data. Create mock implementations for external services and APIs. Implement utilities for resetting the test database between test runs. Configure environment variables for test environments.

## 4. Implement Accessibility and Performance Testing [pending]
### Dependencies: 22.2
### Description: Set up accessibility testing with axe-core and performance testing with Lighthouse CI
### Details:
Install axe-core and integrate it with Playwright for automated accessibility testing. Configure Lighthouse CI for performance, accessibility, best practices, and SEO testing. Create custom accessibility test helpers for common patterns. Set up performance budgets and thresholds. Implement reporting for accessibility and performance issues. Create documentation for interpreting test results and fixing common issues.

## 5. Configure CI/CD and Test Coverage Reporting [pending]
### Dependencies: 22.1, 22.2, 22.3, 22.4
### Description: Set up GitHub Actions workflows for automated testing and implement test coverage reporting with thresholds
### Details:
Create GitHub Actions workflows for running all test types on pull requests and merges to main. Configure Jest for code coverage reporting with Istanbul. Set up coverage thresholds for different parts of the codebase. Implement PR checks that fail if coverage drops below thresholds. Create test summary reports that are attached to PRs. Set up scheduled runs for E2E and performance tests. Configure notifications for test failures.

## 6. Performance Testing Infrastructure [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement performance testing infrastructure for application optimization
### Details:
Set up performance testing infrastructure to measure and monitor application metrics. Implement automated performance regression testing and alerting. Create performance baselines and benchmarking tools. Add support for load testing and stress testing scenarios. Implement Core Web Vitals monitoring and optimization. Create performance testing automation in CI/CD pipeline. Add support for performance analytics and trend analysis.
